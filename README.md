 My Episodes
The My Episodes Skill allows Mycroft to interact with [MyEpisodes.com](http://www.myepisodes.com)

## About 
You will be able to ask Mycroft to check the status of your shows list handled by [MyEpisodes.com](http://www.myepisodes.com). 
At this point Mycroft will be able to give you the number of episodes not acquired and optionally the number of episodes acquired but not watched.

## Examples 
* "check my episodes"
* "any new episodes"
* "check tv shows"
* "any new episodes"
* "anything new on my episodes"

## Posible future features and improvements
* Mark episodes as acquired and/watched 
* Search and add shows to MyEPisodes.com list
* Mark shows as ignored/unignored
* Get status of show relative to the MyEpisodes.com user list (am I watching this show? or am I ignoring this show?)
* Better information ablut current unacquired/unwatched shows by collapsing list of episodes and only speaking one dialog per show (eg: The Show Season 1 Episodes 1 through 5)

## Under devevelopment
* Get details about unwatched/unacquired shows in list like the name of the show the season and episode number

**Please use the Issue reporting facility of Github if you have any ideeas on other functions or if you would like to prioritize the development of one function or another.**
